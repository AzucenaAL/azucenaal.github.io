## A Step Forward in My Health Data Science Journey

For the past few years, I have been immersed in the world of Health Data Science, a fascinating field where technology and healthcare converge to transform the way we understand and utilize biomedical data. Over this time, I have learned a lot, but I continue to discover innovative tools that expand my horizons. Today, I want to share one of them with you: CloudBrain-MRS.

### What is CloudBrain-MRS?

CloudBrain-MRS is a cloud-based platform specifically designed for the analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. MRS is a technique that enables the non-invasive analysis of the biochemical composition of living tissues. It is widely used in research on neurological diseases, cancer, and other metabolic disorders.

**Key Features of CloudBrain-MRS**

âœ… Global accessibility: No need for local software installation.

âš¡ Automation: Reduces manual MRS data processing.

ðŸ§  AI-powered analysis: Provides faster and more accurate biomarker identification.



[This is a link to a different site](https://deanattali.com/) and [this is a link to a section inside this page](#local-urls).

Here's a table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

You can use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to write LaTeX expressions. For example:
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages. You can read more about it [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

![Crepe](/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). Here is proof that it can be fixed:

![Crepe]({{ '/assets/img/crepe.jpg' | relative_url }})
